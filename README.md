## ☀️ Selected Projects & Experience 

### Smart Office Face Recognition System — CI7523  
- Built Python pipeline with MTCNN (detection) and FaceNet/Dlib embeddings; optimised execution and I/O to reduce latency from 2.4s → 1.8s (≈25% faster) on CPU-only systems.  
- Automated secure enrolment, embedding generation, and persistent vector storage, reducing onboarding steps by ~35%.  
- Delivered production-ready CLI and real-time demo with logging and error handling; identification accuracy ~95% across varied lighting/pose conditions.

### Real-Time Financial Forecasting (LSTM) — CI7522  
- Trained LSTM models (TensorFlow/Keras) to forecast GBP/USD using 2020–2025 NASDAQ time-series; improved short-horizon predictive stability by ~28% via tuned sequence lengths and regularisation.  
- Implemented deterministic preprocessing and walk-forward splits to reduce data leakage risk by ~40%.  
- Instrumented MAE/RMSE dashboards and visualisations for faster model selection; optimised inference latency (batching & pruning) to cut per-tick compute by ~22%.

### Classical ML Classification on Digits Dataset — CI7521  
- Built baselines: logistic regression, SVM, random forest; increased validation ROC AUC by ~7% through feature alignment and class-weighting.  
- Used GridSearchCV with constrained search to reduce overfitting indicators by ~25%; standardised evaluation reports (ROC, confusion matrices) to improve interpretability.
